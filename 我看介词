介词主要是从感官上来理解，off就是上升，比如it was feared that the men might have harmed her in some way,or even carried her off with them.这里就是从原地脱离带走的意思
而in在里面，范围。she was hiding in her stall with her head burried among the hey in the manger
in her stall,在她的单间里，空间上是里，among，周围，
在食槽中in the manger
she had taken to flight as soon as the gun went off.子弹从枪管里逃逸出来，off.
each recounting his own exoloits in the battle at the top of his voice.这里的at就是因为嘴里喊出来的集中到了一点
the flag was run up.up向上，升起来了
at 什么地点就指哪一点，I want to meet you at the hotel.I want to meet you in america.
而out就是从一种封闭酝酿状态解放出来，work out算出来，想出来
over 则是覆盖了一片地方，或者越过了。
nonw ead so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill.
所有in +形容词表示情绪，是因为你整个人都处于那种状态之中。比如animal farm里那头猪snowball看了一些农林畜牧业过期的杂志决定在动物庄园推动建造风车，然后还要发电，做电动挤奶机。这时候其它动物听到这些的反应是:The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before(for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery),and they listened in astonishment. in astonishment处于震惊之中。
while Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease ib the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation.
within则表示两端之间，within a few weeks 几周之内
所有你该怎么说一个星期之内还我钱？
I will paid you withing a week.
-- 空间感觉
--
According to Snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons 
and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms
stir up.stir 搅动，向上搅动，会造成什么呢，
所以是激起



对于翻译来说，你并不用管介词，比如这里的on，翻译过来是，丢在了正在燃烧的垃圾火堆上。这个上便是on,in on是相对于感觉上的，如果在参照物的水平线上，则是on,如果是参照物的范围里，则是in.比如in the garden.所以我们说在我们国家，in our country.在公司in company. 在天空中 in the sky.在椅子上on the chair.在沙发上on the sofa
the degrading 
nosebags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in 
the yard
