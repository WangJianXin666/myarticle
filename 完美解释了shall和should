当然还有would还有will
当时我在为寻找一个双精度的数值问题寻找解决方案
结果就找到了这个
I'm trying to round BigDecimal values up, to two decimal places.

I'm using

BigDecimal rounded = value.round(new MathContext(2, RoundingMode.CEILING));
logger.trace("rounded {} to {}", value, rounded);
but it doesn't do what I want consistently:

rounded 0.819 to 0.82
rounded 1.092 to 1.1
rounded 1.365 to 1.4 // should be 1.37
rounded 2.730 to 2.8 // should be 2.74
rounded 0.819 to 0.82
I don't care about significant digits, I just want two decimal places. How do I do this with BigDecimal? Or is there another class/library better suited to this?

注意这个should be,应该是，隐含（过去的）
根据我们的时态法，这里的should可以分解为如下：
过去+应该= should, did shall
所以以后我们如果想问
你应该已经大学毕业了吧？
You should have graduated college?

在另外一个例子里，我看到如下这句。
Shutting down Linux

At this point you should have installed Linux, and you've looked around at what you have. And then when you're finished you'll have to shut off your computer.
