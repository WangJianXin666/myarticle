In school, you learned about nine fundamental types of English words:

nouns, pronouns, articles, verbs, adjectives,
名词，代词，冠词，动词，形容词

adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.
副词，介词，连词和感叹词

like singular vs. plural nouns and superlative vs. comparative adverbs,
单数名词 vs 复数名词 \N 副词最高级 vs 副词比较级

不如叫学生拆词拆到最细。


but unfortunately, there are a lot words that have multiple meanings - like "rose" and "leaves",

which can be used as nouns or verbs.

A digital dictionary alone isn't enough to resolve this ambiguity,
因此开发了 "短语结构规则" 来代表语法规则

so computers also need to know some grammar.

phrase structure rules were developed
