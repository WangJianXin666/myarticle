But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for 
some time past, set up a loud lowing. They had not been milked for 
twenty-four hours, and their udders were almost bursting
milked，因为牛自己无法完成挤奶的动作，只能靠人工去完成。所以这里用了被动时态had not been milked.
被动句

被动句就是 ，不是自己干的。或者自己不能干的。
比如说，他帮我做了作业
my homework was finished by him. 
而我做完了自己的作业就是
I finished my homework

be +动词的过去分词就是被动句，注意是过去分词。
所以

所以
这本书是莎士比亚写的
是
this book is written by Shakespeare 
而不是the book is wrote by  Shakespeare
